/*
Utils are general building blocks. Platform-specific, but not
application-specific

They're useful for abstracting away the configuration for native methods,
or defining new convenience methods for things like working with files,
data munging, etc.

NOTE: Utils should be general enough to be useful in any Node application.
For application-specific concerns, use `helpers.js`.
